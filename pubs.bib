Model outlines depart from this tradition in that they consist of diagrams characterizing the class of models of a given concept expression. We hope this semantically-oriented visualization strategy will allow users to obtain deeper insights about the meaning of such expressions, thereby preventing errors of design or of interpretation.},

In contrast with others knowledge representation systems, Description Logics are equipped with a formal, logic-based semantics.

We present a sequent calculus for ALC, a basic Description Logic. The first motivation  for developing such a system is the extraction of computational content of ALC proofs.

	abstract = {This work employs concepts and tools from Category Theory and Topos Theory to construct a mathematical model for problems, reductions between problems, heuristic search spaces and strategies. More precisely, a search space construction strategy is represented by a functor from a certain category of problems to a certain category of forests. The collection of all such functors forms a topos, a specific model equipped with its own internal logic. This internal logic is then used to define search strategies and heuristics in Local Set Theory. Possible applications of this work include (1) the logical specification and classification of heuristics and metaheuristics used in practice and (2) a more abstract and general rendering of specific results relating the structure of problems to adequate problem-solving methods.},
